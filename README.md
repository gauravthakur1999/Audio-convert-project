# Web Novel Scraper & Text-to-Speech Converter

This project consists of two Python scripts:
1. **novel scraper.py** - Scrapes novel chapters from a website and saves them as text files.
2. **create audio.py** - Converts the scraped text files into audio (.mp3) files using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS).
